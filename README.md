## Code

The software was implemented in `lifex`, a high‚Äêperformance `C++` Finite Element library used for cardiac applications. The software was available in [`lifex` website](https://lifex.gitlab.io/#home) where you can find the first release. The documentation is available [here](https://lifex.gitlab.io/lifex/classlifex_1_1OxygenExchangeAbstract.html).
